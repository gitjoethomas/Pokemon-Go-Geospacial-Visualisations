Short piece of code designed to make visualisation of geo-spacial data in interaction with an ipython widget.

I had originally wanted to a time series analysis to predict where pokemon would turn up, but the amount of data required seems unavailable - just looking at these visualisations there seem to be far fewer occurances of each pokemon than one would expect.

The dropdown doesn't work on github, though the map does. Both work fine locally
