Short piece of code designed to make visualisation of geo-spacial data in interaction with an ipython widget.

300k.csv - the geo-spacial data - https://www.kaggle.com/semioniy/predictemall/downloads/predictemall.zip/3
id_name_looku.csv - came from the pokemon wiki.

I had originally wanted to a time series analysis to predict where pokemon would turn up, but the amount of data required seems unavailable - just looking at these visualisations there seem to be far fewer occurances of each pokemon than one would expect.
