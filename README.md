# Geospacial Visualisation / Pokemon Go

Short piece of code designed to make visualisation of geo-spacial data in interaction with an ipython widget. This is using a dataset from Niantic's Pokemon Go - in which the user follows an app's geolocations to catch Pokemon.

I had originally wanted to a time series analysis to predict where pokemon would turn up, but the amount of data required seems unavailable - Niantic has not made this sort of thing public, and this dataset has been provided by users. 

Just looking at these visualisations there seem to be far fewer occurances of each pokemon than one would expect, though this isn't an issue for a simple visualisation.

The dropdown doesn't work on github, though the map does. Both work fine locally
